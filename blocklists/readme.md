*DNS hostnames*

Some but not all scanners have specific scanners hosthames containing their main domain which makes it easier to block them by this name. Sadly, some have hostnames with dynamic .domain (see Additional file), or do not have domain at all. Also not all systems supporting incoming block by domain name

*IP ranges*

I took my liberty and made list with /24 subnets, not individual hosts. Almost all of such hosts were reported many times but are still active. I do not see it like proper management by these hosts hosters/providers, which makes their nets potentially dangerous. If you prefer individual hosts blocking feel free to make file with them in this repo.
